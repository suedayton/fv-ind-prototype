  <h3 style="font-weight:lighter; margin-top: 10px"><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">7 Roles with 1 Goal&#8213;Keeping your Parent Healthy</span></h3>
  
<p><span>HelpMEwell's secret sauce is the knowledge that when everyone is working with the same information, in this case patient-logged data, then the ability to manage chronic diseases and avert hospitalizations greatly increases.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">HelpMEwell has mulitple ways of logging to allow seniors who may be a little technically challenged to still log easily. Logging can be done via a phone call, texting (SMS), iPhone/iPad apps, or via our web-based apps&#8213;whichever is preferred, or even a combination of them. They don't need a smart phone or computer. They just need a home phone—the system can call them to log their health data.</span></p>

  <h3 style="font-weight:lighter; margin-top: 10px"><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">The HelpMEwell&#8213;Family-View Experience</span></h3>


  <p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">Your parents, or their caregivers, log information in HelpMEwell that their health providers ask them to track. This data goes immediately up to their account at HelpMEwell and is shared with all the care team that have permission from your parent.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">If they have an out-of-range reading that triggers an alert, you and their doctors will get a notification. Catching these risk indicators early, before they turn into complications, keeps your parent healthier and reduces the risk of hospitalization.</span></p>
     
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nzdTrPs.gif" width=100% align title="animated gif of helpmewell logging and showing in family view"/>    
  <p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">The Family-View app is an easy to use technology that's simple and elegant for you. Your parent logs their data and that information is available to you immediately. You are an invaluable as part of the "sauce", both to lend encouragment and to pick up on any changes to activity levels or health signs before they become significant. </span></p> 
  <p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">It gives you an early warning system that's connected. You have your parents close at hand always. </span></p>

  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/KUEtmZA.jpg" width=100% title="quote from patient"/>
    
<h3 style="font-weight:lighter; margin-top: 10px"><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">Meet Ann and Peggy</span></h3>  

<p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">Ann lives across the country from her mom Peggy who has type 2 diabetes and a heart condition. Every morning Peggy checks her blood glucose levels and resting heart rate and then quickly logs the numbers on HelpMEwell via an automated phone call to her. Her doctors have encouraged her to use frequent walks as a way of managing her blood glucose levels. Peggy wears an activity tracker and her patient advocate helped her set up her account so that all of her activity gets sent to HelpMEwell automatically from her Fitbit. She logs her food by typing in her own words what she's eaten. Her favorite meatloaf dish? The HelpMEwell app remembers it once it's been typed in once&#8213;so the next time she eats meatloaf, she has a button for it. Two taps and it's logged. Her daughter Ann can see everything that Peggy is logging, and now when Ann calls she already knows how her mom is doing. She can lend encouragement, or check up if she notices changes. It is the next best thing to being there.</span></p>

  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/cZSGoyq.jpg" width=100% title="quote from expert"/>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">Primary care doctors and specialists get the data from patients logging throughout the day in two ways as well. The doctors have a dashboard for each patient and  can see all the patients history for non-alert items. For alert items, the doctor responsible receives an alert when early warning signs are detected.</span></p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/VBJWuVY.jpg" title="life is why"/>
<h3 style="font-weight:lighter; margin-top: 10px"><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">We need your help and support to get this to needy families. Please help us put Family-View into the hands of those who need it the most.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">Due to the generosity of a group of donors that know HelpMEwell and its mission, the first 4000 family-View apps purchased by this campaign will be matched 1:1 and donated to the ??? Foundation for distribution to families who couldn't afford it otherwise.</span></p>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/5U1DpKD.png" title="HelpMEwell timeline"/>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">Our passion for this project and Family-View comes from the loss of Bruno's sister Pam three years ago due to complications from heart failure. Her death was avoidable. If Family-View and HelpMEwell had existed, alerting Bruno, and Pam's doctor of her complications at home, they would have been able to provide interventions, and she would be alive today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;">We've been working on this for several years now, and we deeply believe that we can help keep your parent healthier and more independent. We've talked with a lot of seniors and their families as we've developed the HelpMEwell system, and the number one message that comes across is autonomy. Your parents want to be independent. So staying on top of their health is paramount. It's our mission to help them.</span></p>
